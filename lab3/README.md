### Results
#### Task 3.1
- The nim_sum_strategy had a good performance against the pure_random winning all the matches.
- The basic_strategy was almost random but it was able to beat the pure_random in some cases depending on the parameters.
#### Task 3.2
- Using the basic_strategy in a genetic algorithm the results look promissing, having some of the individuals winning all the matches of the fitness computation.
Example of individual:
- Genome: Genome(p_longest=0.79, p_take_one=0.17, p_leave_one=0.64, p_take_all=0.24)
- Fitness: 0.9

The solution was based on the code developed in class by professor Squillero.
