Unfortunately, the solution so far haven't been able to solve for N>=8 for inefficiency issues. The only result provided was the following:
Path found with A* search: 
[[0], [2], [1, 3], [4]]
N = 5 | W = 5 | Visited nodes: 9

The solution to lab 1 was based on the A* search algorithm. The code was based on https://stackabuse.com/courses/graphs-in-python-theory-and-implementation/lessons/a-star-search-algorithm/. The discussion of the solution to the problem was done with Sidharrth Nagappan, even though the code was done separately.
